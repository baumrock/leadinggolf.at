# Upgrades

Please see the migration files in the `RockMigrations` folder that are explained here:

## 0.0.1

Create a new field: https://github.com/BernhardBaumrock/Upgrades/blob/master/RockMigrations/0.0.1.php

Run it in Tracy:

```php
$rm = $modules->get('RockMigrations');
$rm->setModule('Upgrades');
$rm->up('0.0.1');
```

And we have our new field in the list :)

### 0.0.3

Ok, let's say we want to get rid of the `search` page and template, so we create a new migration for this purpose: https://github.com/BernhardBaumrock/Upgrades/blob/master/RockMigrations/0.0.3.php
